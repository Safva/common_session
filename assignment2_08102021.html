        <p> The Department of Computer Science & Engineering started functioning from the very beginning of this college. Our field has been pushing the envelope of almost all other disciplines which use computing as a fundamental means of inquiry and tool for discovery. Department of Computer science and engineering provides excellent lab facility with timely up-gradation of the computers, peripherals and 2Mbps internet facility . It also provides facility for access to various national and international journals for good academic support to faculty and students. The department maintains a Library for staff and students, which includes reference books and back up volumes of the previous years’ university question papers, seminar and project reports.</p>
        <p>The Department moulds young outstanding engineers who are academically strong in both theory and practical. It organizes supplementary programs, which include Paper Presentations, Technical seminars & Mock Interviews to prepare the student for a career in the computing field or for graduate study.
             Special orientation is provided to the staff periodically for updating their acumen and to imbibe the latest technological changes. The staff and students are members of the Computer Society of India.

        <h2 id="ece" style="color:rgb(190, 111, 82);">Electronics and Communication Engineering(ECE)</h2>
        <p>ECE, the combination of two major branches of engineering, Electronics and Telecommunication, is one of the largest and fastest growing sectors of the present industry. Electronics engineering distinguishes itself from other technical trades by the constant redefinition of its sphere of influence. This branch of engineering help us to see, hear and communicate over vast distances, supervise production and manufacturing processes and oversee installation and maintenance of computers, peripherals, and components. We work with equipment that use extremely small amounts of power. The role of the electronics engineer is pivotal in realms ranging from the toy industry to consumer electronics, from household articles to space/satellite communication.</p>

            Our course includes theory, design, fabrication, production, testing and manufacture of complex products and systems. We realise the requirements of equipments and components for major industries, including the medical, automotive, robotic, computer and networking sectors. Further, the design of data processing systems for communication, including the defence requirements falls under our purview.</p>


        <h2 id="eee" style="color:rgb(190, 111, 82);">Electrical and Electronics Engineering(EEE)</h2>
        <p>Electrical Engineers are the mainstay of every engineering activity. They power diverse spheres of activity starting from the generation of power, right down to the distribution level. Electrical Engineering has for long accommodated two disciplines – Power and Communication. Power engineers have concentrated on the infrastructural realm– power generation, transmission, distribution, equipment design (rotating & static), electrical drives, consulting, etc. Communication engineers design, control and maintain instrumentation, control, data acquisition, metering accessories among others. This domain spans aerospace, automotive, chemical, metallurgical fields. 
            The strong emphasis on advanced mathematical tools that courses through their syllabus, lends them an acute sense of detail. This gives them strong interdisciplinary skills, cutting across several knowledge bases.</p>
        <p> The last two decades have thrown up new varieties of opportunities like design and application of Photo-Voltaic cells, fuel cells, Energy efficient drives, wind conversion turbines, etc. Application engineers play a major role in the design of systems catering to all these areas. They work closely with all streams of engineering such as mechanical, aeronautical, chemical and electronics to address a wide range of interdisciplinary issues. The gamut of their activities is incredible. In fact, they are often the main arm of several EPC companies.  
            The EEE Department is dedicated to delivering competent electrical engineers to the arena of the real world. They are outfitted with core technical knowledge as well as professional skills necessary to face the challenges of the future. The committed faculty and staff are fully geared up towards this end.</p>
    
    
        <h2 id="me" style="color:rgb(190, 111, 82);">Mechanical Engineering(ME)</h2>
        <p>The Mechanical Engineering Department of Sreepathy Institute of Management and Technology (SIMAT) was established in 2009. In 2011, the first batch of ME branch was started. The Department has well qualified and experienced teaching and non-teaching staff engaged in teaching and development of practical and managerial skills of the students. They also contribute effectively in maintaining discipline and nurturing the personality of the students.  The following facilities have been upgraded for the requirements of all the students: Mechanical workshop, Mechanical laboratories comprising fluid dynamics, hydraulics, heat transfer, heat engines, production, instrumentation & CAD/CAM. A separate Mechanical Engineering Facilities Block is under construction to house all the various requirements   of the ME students. In 2014 we have started one more batch for B-Tech Mechanical Engineering. CNC Turning Centre was inaugurated on 28th October 2014. We have an ambitious plan to develop the department, in a few years, into a research hub comprising of multiple projects leading to reputed publications.</p>
        <p>Mechanical Engineering is one of the oldest branches of engineering. It is often referred to as the “mother” branch of engineering. Another appealing feature of mechanical engineering is that the application base of the study is extremely broad and diverse. Almost all inventions during the ancient period and a vast majority of the findings of modern era are direct contributions of one or the other application of mechanics. It is the discipline of engineering that applies the principles of physics and material science for analysis, design, manufacturing and maintenance of mechanical systems. Mechanical engineering overlaps with aerospace engineering, marine engineering, building services engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, petroleum engineering and chemical engineering in varying amounts. The Mechanical Engineering Department of Sreepathy Institute of Management and Technology (SIMAT) was established in 2009. For the Initial two years, the department provided academic support to the four branches of students of CE, CSE, ECE and EEE. In 2011, the first batch of ME branch was started. The Department has well qualified and experienced teaching and nonteaching staff engaged in teaching and development of practical and managerial skills of the students. They also contribute effectively in maintaining discipline and nurturing the personality of the students.  The following facilities have been upgraded for the requirements of all the students: Mechanical workshop, Mechanical laboratories comprising fluidics, hydraulics, heat transfer, heat engines,production,instrumentation & CAD/CAM. A separate Mechanical Engineering Facilities Block is under construction to house all the various requirements   of the ME students. In 2014 we have started one more batch for B-Tech Mechanical Engineering. CNC Turning Centre was inaugurated on 28th October 2014.
